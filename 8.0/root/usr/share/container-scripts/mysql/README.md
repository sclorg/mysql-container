MySQL 8.0 SQL Database Server container image
=============================================

This container image includes MySQL 8.0 SQL database server for OpenShift and general usage.
Users can choose between RHEL, CentOS and Fedora based images.
The RHEL images are available in the [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/),
the CentOS images are available on [Quay.io/centos7](https://quay.io/organization/centos7),
the CentOS Stream images are available on [Quay.io/sclorg](https://quay.io/organization/sclorg),
and the Fedora images are available in [Fedora Registry](https://quay.io/organization/fedora).
The resulting image can be run using [podman](https://github.com/containers/libpod).

Note: while the examples in this README are calling `podman`, you can replace any such calls by `docker` with the same arguments.

Description
-----------

This container image provides a containerized packaging of the MySQL mysqld daemon
and client application. The mysqld server daemon accepts connections from clients
and provides access to content from MySQL databases on behalf of the clients.
You can find more information on the MySQL project from the project Web site
(https://www.mysql.com/).


Usage
-----

For this, we will assume that you are using the MySQL 8.0 container image from the
Red Hat Container Catalog called `rhscl/mysql-80-rhel7`.
If you want to set only the mandatory environment variables and not store
the database in a host directory, execute the following command:

```
$ podman run -d --name mysql_database -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db -p 3306:3306 rhscl/mysql-80-rhel7
```

This will create a container named `mysql_database` running MySQL with database
`db` and user with credentials `user:pass`. Port 3306 will be exposed and mapped
to the host. If you want your database to be persistent across container executions,
also add a `-v /host/db/path:/var/lib/mysql/data` argument. This will be the MySQL
data directory.

If the database directory is not initialized, the entrypoint script will first
run [`mysql_install_db`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/mysql-install-db.html)
and setup necessary database users and passwords. After the database is initialized,
or if it was already present, `mysqld` is executed and will run as PID 1. You can
 stop the detached container by running `podman stop mysql_database`.


Environment variables and volumes
---------------------------------

The image recognizes the following environment variables that you can set during
initialization by passing `-e VAR=VALUE` to the Docker run command.

**`MYSQL_USER`**  
       User name for MySQL account to be created

**`MYSQL_PASSWORD`**  
       Password for the user account

       Password for the root user (optional)

**`MYSQL_CHARSET`**  
       Default character set (optional)

**`MYSQL_COLLATION`**  
       Default collation (optional)


The following environment variables influence the MySQL configuration file. They are all optional.

**`MYSQL_LOWER_CASE_TABLE_NAMES (default: 0)`**  
       Sets how the table names are stored and compared

**`MYSQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS (default: 151)`**

       The size of the buffer pool where InnoDB caches table and index data

**`MYSQL_INNODB_LOG_FILE_SIZE (default: 8M or 15% of available memory)`**  
       The size of each log file in a log group

**`MYSQL_INNODB_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE (default: 8M or 15% of available memory)`**  
       The size of the buffer that InnoDB uses to write to the log files on disk

**`MYSQL_DEFAULTS_FILE (default: /etc/my.cnf)`**  
       Point to an alternative configuration file

**`MYSQL_BINLOG_FORMAT (default: statement)`**  
       Set sets the binlog format, supported values are `row` and `statement`

**`MYSQL_LOG_QUERIES_ENABLED (default: 0)`**  
       To enable query logging set this to `1`

**`MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN (default: caching_sha2_password)`**  
       Set default authentication plugin. Accepts values `mysql_native_password` or `caching_sha2_password`.

You can also set the following mount points by passing the `-v /host:/container` flag to Docker.

**`/var/lib/mysql/data`**  
       MySQL data directory


**Notice: When mouting a directory from the host into the container, ensure that the mounted
directory has the appropriate permissions and that the owner and group of the directory
matches the user UID or name which is running inside the container.**


MySQL auto-tuning
-----------------

When the MySQL image is run with the `--memory` parameter set and you didn't
specify value for some parameters, their values will be automatically
calculated based on the available memory.

**`MYSQL_KEY_BUFFER_SIZE (default: 10%)`**

       `innodb_log_file_size`

**`MYSQL_INNODB_LOG_BUFFER_SIZE (default: 15%)`**  
       `innodb_log_buffer_size`



MySQL root user
---------------
The root user has no password set by default, only allowing local connections.
You can set it by setting the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable. This
will allow you to login to the root account remotely. Local connections will
still not require a password.

To disable remote root access, simply unset `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` and restart
the container.


Changing passwords
------------------

Since passwords are part of the image configuration, the only supported method
to change passwords for the database user (`MYSQL_USER`) and root user is by
changing the environment variables `MYSQL_PASSWORD` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`,
respectively.

Changing database passwords through SQL statements or any way other than through
the environment variables aforementioned will cause a mismatch between the
values stored in the variables and the actual passwords. Whenever a database
container starts it will reset the passwords to the values stored in the
environment variables.


Default my.cnf file
-------------------
With environment variables we are able to customize a lot of different parameters
or configurations for the mysql bootstrap configurations. If you'd prefer to use
your own configuration file, you can override the `MYSQL_DEFAULTS_FILE` env
variable with the full path of the file you wish to use. For example, the default
location is `/etc/my.cnf` but you can change it to `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` by setting
 `MYSQL_DEFAULTS_FILE=/etc/mysql/my.cnf`


Extending image
---------------
This image can be extended in Openshift using the `Source` build strategy or via the standalone
[source-to-image](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-s2i_create-images) application (where available).
For this, we will assume that you are using the `rhscl/mysql-80-rhel7` image,
available via `mysql:8.0` imagestream tag in Openshift.


For example, to build a customized MySQL database image `my-mysql-rhel7`
with a configuration from `https://github.com/sclorg/mysql-container/tree/master/examples/extend-image` run:

```
$ oc new-app mysql:8.0~https://github.com/sclorg/mysql-container.git \
	--name my-mysql-rhel7 \
	--context-dir=examples/extend-image \
	--env MYSQL_OPERATIONS_USER=opuser \
	--env MYSQL_OPERATIONS_PASSWORD=oppass \
	--env MYSQL_DATABASE=opdb \
	--env MYSQL_USER=user \
	--env MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass
```

or via s2i:

```
$ s2i build --context-dir=examples/extend-image https://github.com/sclorg/mysql-container.git rhscl/mysql-80-rhel7 my-mysql-rhel7
```

The directory passed to Openshift can contain these directories:

`mysql-cfg/`
    When starting the container, files from this directory will be used as
    a configuration for the `mysqld` daemon.
    `envsubst` command is run on this file to still allow customization of
    the image using environmental variables

`mysql-pre-init/`
    Shell scripts (`*.sh`) available in this directory are sourced before
    `mysqld` daemon is started.

`mysql-init/`
    Shell scripts (`*.sh`) available in this directory are sourced when
    `mysqld` daemon is started locally. In this phase, use `${mysql_flags}`
    to connect to the locally running daemon, for example `mysql $mysql_flags < dump.sql`

Variables that can be used in the scripts provided to s2i:

`$mysql_flags`
    arguments for the `mysql` tool that will connect to the locally running `mysqld` during initialization

`$MYSQL_RUNNING_AS_MASTER`
    variable defined when the container is run with `run-mysqld-master` command

`$MYSQL_RUNNING_AS_SLAVE`
    variable defined when the container is run with `run-mysqld-slave` command

`$MYSQL_DATADIR_FIRST_INIT`
    variable defined when the container was initialized from the empty data dir

During the s2i build all provided files are copied into `/opt/app-root/src`
directory into the resulting image. If some configuration files are present
in the destination directory, files with the same name are overwritten.
Also only one file with the same name can be used for customization and user
provided files are preferred over default files in
`/usr/share/container-scripts/mysql/`- so it is possible to overwrite them.

Same configuration directory structure can be used to customize the image
every time the image is started using `podman run`. The directory has to be
mounted into `/opt/app-root/src/` in the image
(`-v ./image-configuration/:/opt/app-root/src/`).
This overwrites customization built into the image.


Securing the connection with SSL
--------------------------------
In order to secure the connection with SSL, use the extending feature described
above. In particular, put the SSL certificates into a separate directory:

    sslapp/mysql-certs/server-cert-selfsigned.pem
    sslapp/mysql-certs/server-key.pem

And then put a separate configuration file into mysql-cfg:

    $> cat sslapp/mysql-cfg/ssl.cnf
    [mysqld]
    ssl-key=${APP_DATA}/mysql-certs/server-key.pem
    ssl-cert=${APP_DATA}/mysql-certs/server-cert-selfsigned.pem

Such a directory `sslapp` can then be mounted into the container with -v,
or a new container image can be built using s2i.


Upgrading and data directory version checking
---------------------------------------------

MySQL and MariaDB use versions that consist of three numbers X.Y.Z (e.g. 5.6.23).
For version changes in Z part, the server's binary data format stays compatible and thus no
special upgrade procedure is needed. For upgrades from X.Y to X.Y+1, consider doing manual
steps as described at
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html.

Skipping versions like from X.Y to X.Y+2 or downgrading to lower version is not supported;
the only exception is ugrading from MariaDB 5.5 to MariaDB 10.0.

**Important**: Upgrading to a new version is always risky and users are expected to make a full
back-up of all data before.

A safer solution to upgrade is to dump all data using `mysqldump` or `mysqldbexport` and then
load the data using `mysql` or `mysqldbimport` into an empty (freshly initialized) database.

Another way of proceeding with the upgrade is starting the new version of the `mysqld` daemon
and run `mysql_upgrade` right after the start. This so called in-place upgrade is generally
faster for large data directory, but only possible if upgrading from the very previous version,
so skipping versions is not supported.

This container detects whether the data needs to be upgraded using `mysql_upgrade` and
we can control it by setting `MYSQL_DATADIR_ACTION` variable, which can have one or more of the following values:

 * `upgrade-warn` -- If the data version can be determined and the data come from a different version
   of the daemon, a warning is printed but the container starts. This is the default value.
   Since historically the version file `mysql_upgrade_info` was not created, when using this option,
   the version file is created if not exist, but no `mysql_upgrade` will be called.
   However, this automatic creation will be removed after few months, since the version should be
   created on most deployments at that point.
 * `upgrade-auto` -- `mysql_upgrade` is run at the beginning of the container start, when the local
   daemon is running, but only if the data version can be determined and the data come
   with the very previous version. A warning is printed if the data come from even older
   or newer version. This value effectively enables automatic upgrades,
   but it is always risky and users should still back-up all the data before starting the newer container.
   Set this option only if you have very good back-ups at any moment and you are fine to fail-over
   from the back-up.
 * `upgrade-force` -- `mysql_upgrade --force` is run at the beginning of the container start, when the local
   daemon is running, no matter what version of the daemon the data come from.
   This is also the way to create the missing version file `mysql_upgrade_info` if not present
   in the root of the data directory; this file holds information about the version of the data.

There are also some other actions that you may want to run at the beginning of the container start,
when the local daemon is running, no matter what version of the data is detected:

 * `optimize` -- runs `mysqlcheck --optimize`. It optimizes all the tables.
 * `analyze` -- runs `mysqlcheck --analyze`. It analyzes all the tables.
 * `disable` -- nothing is done regarding data directory version.

Multiple values are separated by comma and run in-order, e.g. `MYSQL_DATADIR_ACTION="optimize,analyze"`.


Changing the replication binlog_format
--------------------------------------
Some applications may wish to use `row` binlog_formats (for example, those built
  with change-data-capture in mind). The default replication/binlog format is
  `statement` but to change it you can set the `MYSQL_BINLOG_FORMAT` environment
  variable. For example `MYSQL_BINLOG_FORMAT=row`. Now when you run the database
  with `master` replication turned on (ie, set the Docker/container `cmd` to be
`run-mysqld-master`) the binlog will emit the actual data for the rows that change
as opposed to the statements (ie, DML like insert...) that caused the change.


Changing the authentication plugin
----------------------------------
MySQL 8.0 introduced 'caching_sha2_password' as its default authentication plugin.
It is faster and provides better security then the previous default authentication plugin.
However, not all software implements this algorithm, and client applications might report
issue like "The server requested authentication method".

The plugin can be changed by setting `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN` environment variable,
which accepts values `caching_sha2_password` (the default one) or `mysql_native_password`.
To change the behaviour back to the same behavior as MySQL 5.7 (for client applications that do not
support `caching_sha2_password`), set the `MYSQL_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_PLUGIN=mysql_native_password`.


Troubleshooting
---------------
The mysqld deamon in the container logs to the standard output, so the log is available in the container log. The log can be examined by running:

    podman logs <container>
