# MySQL 8.0.4 introduced 'caching_sha2_password' as its default authentication plugin.
# It is faster and provides better security then the previous default authentication plugin.
#
# However, not all software implements this algorithm, and client applications might report
# issue like "The server requested authentication method"
#
# The plugin can be changed by setting default_authentication_plugin variable,
# which was later replaced by authentication_policy which allows multifactor authentication.
# This container image uses the authentication_policy set to "caching_sha2_password,,"
# by default to maintain the default allowed plugin to be a stronger caching_sha2_password,
# similarly as it was set by default in MySQL 8.0.
# That is a different value from the MySQL's default "*,,".
# Consult the authentication_policy option documentation for more details.
#
# To change the behaviour back to the same behavior as MySQL 5.7 had, set the
# authentication_policy variable to "mysql_native_password,,".
# Mind that mysql_native_password plugin is deprecated in MySQL 8.4 and disabled by default.
# It must be enabled by setting mysql_native_password=ON server configuration option
# before using in authentication_policy.
